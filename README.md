# SOFI

SOFI or Stop On Full Inventory is a small script I wrote for CC tweaked. It detects if an inventory is full and outputs a redstone signal if it is. I wrote this to work with functional storage's storage controller to determine if a group of drawers was full. 

Yes, it is basically just a comparator with more steps.

# Settings
